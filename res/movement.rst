Commands will assume facing right, and using numpad notation.

Guarding

Block: Hold any direction away from your opponent. You will only actually block when an opponent's attack would hit you.

* Note: Holding up-back on the ground (7) in neutral state will cause you to jump, leaving you vulnerable during the jump startup frames. After that, the block in the air will count as an air block. In general, air blocks are vulnerable to grounded attacks but can block ground projectiles.

* Holding directly back (4) will put you into a standing block against approaching attacks. Standing blocks block high attacks (such as most non-projectile air attacks) and mid attacks, but not low attacks.

* Holding down-back (1) will put you into a crouching position, from which you can crouch block. Crouch blocks block mid attacks and low attacks, but not high attacks.

* EX Guard: Similar to Guilty Gear's Instant Block or Garou's Just Defend. Input a guard right before an attack connects to trigger a gold flash and the words "EX Guard". A multi-hit attack or block string can be EX Guarded multiple times: tap away even during blockstun. Successful EX Guards restore guard meter, reduce blockstun by 2f (need confirmation on this), increase magic circuit gain rate and reduce the opponent's magic circuit gain rate from the guarded attack.

Jumps

* (Neutral) Jump(8): AKA jumping straight up. This is very different from Jump(7) and Jump(9), in that you can drift forward or backward in the air by pressing 6 or 4 before you reach the top of the jump arc.

* Doublejump: Input by pressing an upward direction in midair to jump in that direction. Will force you to face toward the opponent. Must land or get hit before you are able to do it again. Neutral double jump can drift like neutral jump.

* Superjump: Tap any downward direction, then 8 (for a neutral superjump) or 9 (for a forward superjump). A jump that goes farther, higher, and faster than usual, but with slightly higher startup.

* Super Double Jump: A doublejump that goes higher and farther than usual. Can be input in two ways: the Superjump command, or just tap 9 with 1f timing. While the 1f timing sounds difficult in theory, it is very easy to do if you need to do a super doublejump during a combo: Just press and release 9 during the hitstop of the air move you are going to super doublejump cancel.

Dashes and dodges

* Dash: Press 66 or 6A+B to dash forward and 44 or 4A+B to dash away. Most (all?) ground backdashes have startup invincibility frames.

* Air Dash: Input the dash command in the air to go in that direction. Will NOT force you to face toward the opponent. Must land or get hit before you are able to do it again. To instantly air dash, you must input 6956, 9656 or 4754 or do 96A+B.

* Ground Dodge: Available to Crescent and Half moon only. Input by pressing 2E or 2A+B on the ground. Ground dodges have invincible startup, and are strike invulnerable but can be thrown.

* Air Dodge: Available to Crescent and Half moon only. Input by pressing 2E or 2A+B in the air. Same properties as ground dodge, but has two extra properties: they will brake your air momentum and will force your character to face the opponent. You will be unable to act until you touch the ground or get hit.

Techs

* Throw tech: Pressing A+D when just grabbed by a regular throw. You can tech out of throws with 1A+D as an option select, which would come out as shield if you aren't grabbed.

* Ground Tech: Some knockdown-inducing moves allow you to ground tech. Ground techs can go either forwards, backwards, or neutral, which are input by pressing 6, 4, or 8 respectively right before you hit the ground. All techs have a bit of recovery at the end. Neutral techs start up a bit faster than forwards and back techs.

* Air Tech: Press any button in the air once hitstun has ended to recover. If you are holding a leftward or rightward direction, you will tech left or right.

Option Selects

* 1A+D: Either techs an incoming Throw or performs a Low Shield.
