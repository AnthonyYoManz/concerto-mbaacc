A, B, and C correspond to weak, medium, and heavy attacks respectively.

The D button functions as shield, which is a parry mechanism. Specifics of the D button vary with the Moon style. 

* 236D/j.236D (After successful Shield): Launching counter hit follow up. Can be guarded if timed right. (Full moon only)

* 214D (Can be done while blocking): Shield Bunker. (All moons, though Half has a unique Shield Bunker when done while blocking.)

The E button (labeled "QA" ("Quick Action") in game config) is the in-game macro button which outputs different button combinations depending on the direction held (regardless of the character's state). Does not do anything on diagonals. 

* 5E: Acts as A+B+C.

  * [Ground Only] Activate Heat or Blood Heat (Crescent), Circuit Charge or Active Blood Heat (Full).

  * [Ground/Air] (while blocking/being hit) Circuit Spark (Crescent, Full; Half in a special case).
  
* 4/6E: Acts as A+D (resulting in 4/6A+D)
  
  * Throw/Air Throw and Throw Tech.

* 2E: Acts as A+B. Results in 2A+B.

  * Dodge and Air Dodge (Crescent, Half).

The only direction/button combination that can't be done with the E button is 4/6A+B or j.4/6 A+B, which gives you a dash/backdash or airdash/airbackdash.
