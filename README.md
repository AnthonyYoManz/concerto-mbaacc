Concerto is a graphical front end for CCCaster. This is a prototyping build used to test basic features for advanced implementation.

To use it, just drop concerto.exe in the same folder as CCCaster. You need to be using the latest version of CCCaster and your caster EXE needs to be named "cccaster.v3.0.exe" to work.

Other players can connect to your online versus host without Concerto as long as they use the same version of CCCaster.

For best usage don't open CCCaster or MBAA.exe on their own while using this program.

If you want to report bugs you can dm shiburizu#7634 on Discord.

HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE, ENJOY AND EXPECT BUGS
